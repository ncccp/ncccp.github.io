    blurb: Chris Joe was born and raised in San Francisco and attended the University of California, Davis where he attained a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. During his time at UC Davis, he worked and participated in a diversity of activities that have helped him become the best pharmacist he could be. From serving as the Pre-Pharmacy Peer Advisor for the entire UC Davis campus to studying pain and itch under Dr. Earl Carstens, he developed a passion for pharmacy and prepared himself to handle the roles and responsibilities of a pharmacist. While at University of the Pacific, he continues to be involved as a Co-Chair for the Northern California College of Clinical Pharmacy (NCCCP) Committee, where he has determined to pursue a focused career in clinical pharmacy and research. He eventually would like to return to the University and teach. Aside from a career in pharmacy, he enjoys hiking, sightseeing, and of course, running.
