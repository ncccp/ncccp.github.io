While at University of the Pacific, he continues to be involved as a Co-Chair for the Northern California College of Clinical Pharmacy (NCCCP) Committee, where he has determined to pursue a focused career in clinical pharmacy and research. He eventually would like to return to the University and teach. Aside from a career in pharmacy, he enjoys hiking, sightseeing, and of course, running.
